# Recoil State Management Example

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/ltwlf/react-recoil-example/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

I used this project to test and learn [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/). First I found it frustrating to work with atoms and selectors in components, but in the end, I was happy with encapsulating the Recoil API in custom hooks.
I used posts and comments from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com as mock API. When you add comments they will not be really saved.
The example has zero stylings and is not perfect, but helped me to get familiar with Recoil.
